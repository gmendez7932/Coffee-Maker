 *  WithFlavor is a special class that contains the Flavor add-on.
 *  Since there can be multiple flavors, all of which share the same
 *  costs and methods they are all put in here.
 *  This way, flavors can be easily added or removed by just interacting
 *  with this class without much issue to code.
