# Coffee-Maker
Coffee-Maker is a program that is used to help Coffee Shops have an application that is able to make orders and hold an inventory.
To use the program it requires a Inventory.txt file to read through that is structured as "Ingredient= #" where the # is an int.

Once it has this, the program will show the user its menu and then prompt the user to make a selection using a number.
1. User will be prompted a series of questions to build a coffee object then add this object to their order list.
   once this is made, the user will be prompted to exit or continue adding to the order. Exiting will bring the user back to the main menu.
2. User can re-load the inventory to view what is currently in the inventory.
3. User uses this after making orders to update the inventory and correctly subtract the used ingredients from the orders.
4. User can expand their inventory if they need to add more of an ingredient
5. User can use this to view the orders that the application has made that session
6. User can use this to exit the code.
